Setup
=====

To begin, let's get the code:

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/cognitedata/cognite-python-utils.git
    $ cd cognite-python-utils

The current project uses `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/docs/>`_ to manage
dependencies among different Python packages, which is essential to reproducibility.

First, ensure you are using the right version of Python (``^3.8``). We recommend you
use `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_ to effectively manage multiple versions
of Python installation. You can then install ``poetry``:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install poetry

Once you clone the current repo into your local machine, you can go inside the repo and run:

.. code:: bash

    $ poetry install

to install the right versions of packages for running scripts in the project repo.

To use the new Python configuration that has been installed, you need to run:

.. code:: bash

    $ poetry shell

which will activate the virtual environment for the project repo.

You can simply type:

.. code:: bash

    $ exit

to exit from the virtual environment and return to the global (or system) Python installation.
